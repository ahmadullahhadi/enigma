### üîÑ Migration Guide

#### For Existing Users
1. **No breaking changes** - Bot works with existing configurations
2. **Optional upgrade** - Download-first mode enabled by default

#### For New Users
1. **Recommended setup** - Use download-first mode for best experience
2. **Storage consideration** - Ensure adequate temporary storage space
3. **Network optimization** - Download-first reduces bandwidth during playback

### üìä Performance Impact

#### Storage

- **Location**: System temp directory (`/tmp/discord_bot_audio` on Linux)

#### Network
- **Download phase**: Higher initial bandwidth usage
- **Playback phase**: Zero network usage (local file)
- **Overall**: More predictable bandwidth patterns

#### CPU/Memory
- **Minimal impact**: Efficient temporary file management
- **Auto-cleanup**: Prevents storage accumulation
- **Optimized**: Concurrent downloads and playback

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability Improvements

#### Error Handling

### üìù Bot Permissions

#### Required Permissions for Channel Names
- **"Manage Channels"**: Required in voice channels for name updates
