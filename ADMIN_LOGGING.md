## 🔧 Configuration

### **Admin Channel ID**
The admin log channel is hardcoded in the bot for security:

```python
# In cogs/music.py
ADMIN_LOG_CHANNEL_ID = 1429170343221919794
```

### **How to Change Admin Channel**
1. Open `cogs/music.py`
2. Find line with `ADMIN_LOG_CHANNEL_ID = 1429170343221919794`
3. Replace with your admin channel ID
4. Restart the bot

### **Getting Your Channel ID**
1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings → Advanced)
2. Right-click your admin channel
3. Click "Copy ID"
4. Paste into `ADMIN_LOG_CHANNEL_ID`

## 🎨 Log Embed Colors

Logs use color-coding for quick visual identification:

- **🟢 Green**: Track starts, resumes, joins, success events
- **🟠 Orange**: Skips, leaves, warnings
- **🔴 Red**: Stops, errors, disconnects
- **🔵 Blue**: Queue updates, loop changes
- **🟣 Purple**: Session reports, summaries
- **⚪ Grey**: General actions

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### **AdminLogger Class**
```python
class AdminLogger:
    """Admin-only logging system for music bot activity."""
    
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
        self.admin_channel_id = ADMIN_LOG_CHANNEL_ID
    
    async def log(self, title, description, color, fields, guild):
        # Core logging method
    
    async def log_track_play(self, guild, track, requester, position):
        # Log track playback
    
    async def log_track_skip(self, guild, track, user, reason):
        # Log track skips
    
    async def log_playback_action(self, guild, action, user, details):
        # Log pause/resume/stop/loop
    
    async def log_queue_update(self, guild, action, track, user):
        # Log queue modifications
    
    async def log_voice_event(self, guild, event, channel, user):
        # Log join/leave/disconnect
    
    async def log_error(self, guild, error_type, message, context):
        # Log errors and exceptions
    
    async def log_session_summary(self, guild, tracks, duration, ...):
        # Log session reports
```

### **Integration Points**
- ✅ Track playback start (`_play_next`)
- ✅ Button handlers (pause/resume/skip/loop/stop/leave)
- ✅ Voice state updates (join/disconnect)
- ✅ Error handlers (playback errors, connection failures)
- ✅ Queue operations (track additions)
- ✅ Session end (all disconnect scenarios)

---

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### **Graceful Degradation**
```python
# Logging never crashes the bot
try:
    await admin_logger.log_track_play(...)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[AdminLog] Error sending log: {e}")
    # Bot continues normal operation
```

### **Channel Availability**
- Bot attempts to get channel from cache first
- Falls back to fetching if not cached
- Silently fails if channel unavailable
- Logs error to console only

### **Permission Handling**
- No special permissions required
- Bot must have access to admin channel
- Must have "Send Messages" and "Embed Links"
- Falls back gracefully if missing

---

## 📊 Log Volume Estimates

### **Small Server (5-10 users)**
- ~50-100 logs per hour during active use
- ~5-10 session reports per day
- Minimal admin channel traffic

### **Medium Server (50-100 users)**
- ~500-1000 logs per hour during peak times
- ~50-100 session reports per day
- Moderate admin channel activity

### **Large Server (500+ users)**
- ~5000+ logs per hour during peak times
- ~500+ session reports per day
- High admin channel traffic

**Recommendation**: Use a dedicated admin channel with no other messages.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **What's Private**
- ✅ All logs only visible in admin channel
- ✅ Users never see session reports
- ✅ No public activity tracking
- ✅ No user-facing log messages

### **What's Logged**
