# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
# This is a generated file! Do not edit.

# IMPORTANT: This is just an example file showing the format.
# You need to export your actual cookies from your browser.

# See YOUTUBE_COOKIES_GUIDE.md for instructions on how to export cookies.
#
# Once you have your cookies.txt file:
# 1. Place it in this directory (same folder as this example file)
# 2. Rename it to just "cookies.txt" (remove .example)
# 3. Restart the bot
#
# Your actual cookies.txt should contain lines like:
# .youtube.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1234567890	COOKIE_NAME	cookie_value
#
# DO NOT commit your actual cookies.txt to Git - it contains sensitive data!
# The file cookies.txt is already in .gitignore for your protection.
